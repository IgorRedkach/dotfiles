This tutorial is intended to give you step by step guide on setting up GlusterFS on CentOS 7/RHEL 7 Server.
To use this tutorial, you'll need a  RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 server. Details on installing the OS are not provided here; consult official OS's doc.

Since this guide aims at helping you get GlusterFS up and running in as short a time as possible, detailed steps are not provided.
For further learning, it's recommended you read GlusterFS Admin Guide.

## GLusterFS?
GLusterFS is POSIX-compliant distributed file system that can scale to several peta-bytes storage.Here, data is stored in distributed way; replicated across all storage servers(nodes) in the cluster.

GlusterFS can easily manage usntructured data for physical, virtual, and cloud environments.

## Why GlusterFS?
- Flexible and agile scaling
- No metadata server
- Aggregated storage and memory
- Works on standard-based clients, applications and networks 
- High redundancy
- Simple and inexpensive deployment
- Work with thousands of clients
    * Easy scale-out; add GlusterFS nodes to trusted pool- (improved cluster performance)
    * Easy scale-up; expands GlusterFS volume by adding disks and file systems to node 

## GlusterFS Components
- gluster
- glusterd
- glusterfs
- glusterfsd
- mount.glusterfs

## Terminology
 **Brick**:
- This is the File system mount point
- It is a unit of storage used as GlusterFS building block
 
**Translator**
 
         Logic between bits and global namespace
 
         Layered to provide GlusterFS functionality
 
**Volume**
 
         Bricks combined and passed through translators
 
**Node**
 
         Server running gluster daemon and sharing volumes

## Setting up High Availability Storage with GlusterFS on CentOS 7 and RHEL 7

### Prereqs
- Two  freshly installed and running CentOS 7/RHEL 7 servers
- The two servers are named server1 and server2, under example.com domain
- A working network connection. Internet connection required if not making use of local repository
- At least two virtual disks. Os installed on sda/vda and GlusterFS served on sdb/vdb
- Have enough space on backing file system for GlusterFS dynamically generated configuration files; stored at var/lib/glusterd
