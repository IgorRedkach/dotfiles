CLI has two modes:
Operational : In operational mode, you monitor everything about the routerâ€™s hardware and software and check on network operation

Configuration : In configuration mode, the commands let you define the behavior of the router, 
such as indicating what network addresses to use and protocols to run.

First time configurations
> cli
> configure

- Another time-saving command is run, which allows you to issue an operational command from within configuration mode. 
- For example, the run show route command from configuration mode is the same as the show route command from operational mode:
# run show route
> show route
