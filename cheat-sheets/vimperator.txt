History and Bookmarks
> To view the browser history, just type 
:history

> To move back one in the history, use Ctrl-o or H and to move forward in your browser history, use Ctrl-i or L. Just like Vim, you can add a “count” to the command as well — so if you want to go back two pages, just use 2H or to go forward three pages you can use 3L

> To add a new bookmark, just type A. This will add a new bookmark for the current page. Or you can remove a bookmark for the page by hitting A again. This is similar to just using the star in the Awesome bar with standard Firefox.

>To set a QuickMark, type M followed by an letter or number (0 through 9 only, QuickMarks doesn’t do double digits). For instance, if you wanted to assign Linux-Mag.com to the letter L while you were on the page, type ML.

To go to that bookmark, type:
goL
