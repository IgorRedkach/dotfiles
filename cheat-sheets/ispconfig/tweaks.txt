- By disabling ClamAV (email anti-virus), and Amavis (one of the two email spam filters), you can save about 150MB of server memory.

Edit Postfix to stop using Amavis. Type this into your shell (SSH) console window:

# vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

Add the "#" symbol in front of two entries in the Postfix configuration file, to "comment out" the unneeded lines of code. Note that commenting out is preferred to deleting -- in case you change your mind later. These two lines should appear at the very end of the conf file.

Code:

# content_filter = amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024 
# receive_override_options = no_address_mappings


Save, go back to console.

Restart Postfix with the following command in shell:
Code:

/etc/init.d/postfix restart

One by one, stop each service:
Code:

/etc/init.d/clamav-daemon stop
/etc/init.d/clamav-freshclam stop
/etc/init.d/spamassassin stop
/etc/init.d/amavis stop

Next, disable the startup for ClamAV and Amavis. Again, one at a time:
Code:

update-rc.d -f clamav-daemon remove
update-rc.d -f clamav-freshclam remove
update-rc.d -f spamassassin remove
update-rc.d -f amavis remove


Understand that the spam and anti-virus options will still be visible in ISPConfig 3. However, they will not function, and will be ignored by the server. If you update Postfix or ISPConfig, these changes may be wiped out (files overwritten), and must be repeated.

To block spam, simply use the DNS blacklists option in Postfix, which are generally more effective anyway.
