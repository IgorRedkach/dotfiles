> SSL key, a CSR, and a self-signed certificate 

# ls -l /usr/local/ispconfig/interface/ssl/
empty.dir  ispserver.crt  ispserver.csr  ispserver.key  ispserver.key.secure

All we need in this tutorial is the private key (ispserver.key) and the CSR (ispserver.csr); we will replace ispserver.crt with the Class1 certificate from StartSSL. You can ignore ispserver.key.secure.
It is also possible to create ispserver.key and ispserver.csr on the command line as follows:

# cd /usr/local/ispconfig/interface/ssl/
# openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -keyout ispserver.key -out ispserver.csr
