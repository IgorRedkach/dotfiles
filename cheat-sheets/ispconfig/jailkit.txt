Create a user to be jailed using jailkit

# adduser kim

Provide the jail with some of the default program environment as:

# jk_init -v /opt/jail netutils basicshell jk_lsh ssh sftp scp  

> Values to be used are available at /etc/jailkit/jk_init.ini

Now the jail is ready, now add the user inside the environment

# jk_jailuser -m -j /var/www/kim.com  kim

> Check values in /etc/passwd

# cat /etc/passwd | grep kim

> Now the user have been added in the jailed env, connect Debian server

# ssh kim@server
