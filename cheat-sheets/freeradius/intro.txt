RADIUS- Remote Access Dial In User Service

RADIUS server

- The RADIUS protocol is client/server based
- The RADIUS server will listen on UDP port 1812 and 1813. Port 1812 is used for authentication
- This will involve Access-Request, Access-Accept, Access-Reject, and Access-Challenge packets. 
- Port 1813 is used for accounting.
- This will involve Accounting-Request and Accounting-Response packets.

RADIUS client
- The client acts as a broker between the RADIUS server and a user or device that wants to gain network access.
- The proxying functionality of RADIUS also allows one RADIUS server to be the client of another RADIUS sever, which eventually can form a chain.
