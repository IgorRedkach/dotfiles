Satellite server components

- Red Hat satellite 6 is a system management tool that can be used to configure new systems and provide software updates from Red Hat Network
- It serves as a local repository of software content and a central point of management for Red Hat entitlements.
- It also performs provisioning and configuration  management of systems to adhere to predefined standard operating environments.
- With the addition of the Satellite capsule server to its architecture, Red Hat Satellite 6 can scale effectively to meet the demands of large enterprises.
- With the correct design, Satellite Server, in conjuction with Satellite capsule servers, can deliver solid performance in the face of increasing workloads, even across a geographically distributed environment.

- Client systems must have the Red Hat Subscription Manager software installed in order to receive software updates from Red Hat Satellite Server

Managing Satellite Server

1. A web browser can be used to manage Satellite server through its web UI.
2. A command-line interface is also available
3. API for programmers to do custom workflows or task automation

Components

1. Foreman
- Open source app used for provisioning and life cycle management of physical and virtual hosts.
- Can be used to automatically configure systems using various methiods:
        Kickstart
        Puppet modules
- Foreman also provides historical data for reporting, auditing, and troubleshooting

2. Katello
- Serves as subscription and repository management application.
- Provides a means to subscribe to Red Hat repositories and download content
- Different versions of this content can be applied to specific hosts to match the needs of systems in different stages of the SDLC

3. Candlepin
- Service within Katello that handles subscription management

4. Pulp
- Service within Katello that hanbles repository and content management

5. Hammer
- CLI tool that provides command line and shell equivalents of most of the fuctions available through the Satellite Server's web UI

6. REST API
- RESTful API service that allows system admins and developers to write custom scripts and third party applications that interface with Re Hat Satellite

7. Capsule server
- Offers the ability to provide a proxy for some of the main Satellite fuctions, including repository storage, DNS, DHCP and Puppet master configuration
- Each Satellite Server contains an integrated capsule server instance.
- For distributed environments, additional capsule server instances can be deployed on separate hosts.
- These capsule server systems can provide redundancy for the Satellite Server services to offer high availability and scale greater workloads as the number of client systems increase.

Satellite infrastructure layout and topology

1. Standalone Satellite Server: Integrated capsule
2. Satellite server with local capsule servers: In larger environments, additional capsule servers can be added to ease the workload on Satellite Server.
3. Satellite Server with remote capsule servers
