- Need to modify two files
1. /etc/grub.d/01_users
- comment out all lines to disable root as superuser
Add

cat <<EOF
set superusers="bob"
password bob somepassword
password lisa somepassword # Lisa is non superuser
EOF

2. /etc/grub.d/40_custom
- get menuentry
# grep menuentry /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
copy the lines:
    menuentry
    set root
    linux16
    initrd16

- After the line menuentry added to 40_custom, at the end of menuentry add
--users bob before {

Write changes to 
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

- On boot you'll enter username nd password
