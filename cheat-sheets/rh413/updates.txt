# rpa -qa gpg-pubkey

# rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-no

- To remove a key from the RPM GPG keying, again it is an rpm transaction
# rpm -e gpg-pubkey-no

- With GPG keys imported into the RPM keying, admin may use rpm to verify the signature of downloaded package against
trusted keys installed in the RPM database.
# rpm -K /package-name
# rpm -vvK package-name 2>/dev/null

Validate RPM Scripts
- admin can query an installed RPM to look at these scripts using
# rpm -q --scripts <PACKAGENAME>
and
# rpm -q --triggers <PACKAGENAME>

- To view the same on uninstalled package
# rpm -qp  --scripts <PACKAGEFILE>
# rpm -qp --triggers <PACKAGEFILE>

- To perform an RPM transaction skipping scripts, use --noscripts argument with the rpm command

# man 1 gpg
# gpg --help
# man 5 yum.conf
# man 9 rpm
