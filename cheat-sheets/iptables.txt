There are several different things you can do with iptables. You start with three built-in chains INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD which you can't delete. Let's look at the operations to manage whole chains:

Create a new chain (-N).
Delete an empty chain (-X).
Change the policy for a built-in chain. (-P).
List the rules in a chain (-L).
Flush the rules out of a chain (-F).
Zero the packet and byte counters on all rules in a chain (-Z).
There are several ways to manipulate rules inside a chain:

Append a new rule to a chain (-A).
Insert a new rule at some position in a chain (-I).
Replace a rule at some position in a chain (-R).
Delete a rule at some position in a chain, or the first that matches (-D).
