Class Setup

    Your unique class setup is ALL cloud based.

    You need only a computer with a web browser and SSH client installed to access your training environment.

    Your setup runs for up to 2 days after the training ends and it is accessible from anywhere.

    Each environment has a unique GUID to separate you from your peers.

    The next page shows the names and IP addresses for the entities in your environment.
