    Extending Logical Volumes

Implementing LVM Storage

    LVM comes with set of command line tools for implementing and managing LVM storage

    Tools can be used in scripts, making them suitable for automation

Managing Logical Volumes
Creating a Logical Volume

    Prepare physical device:

        Use fdisk, gdisk, or parted to create new partition for use with LVM

        Set the partition type:

            Use Linux LVM on LVM partitions

            Use 0x8e for MBR-style partitions

        If necessary, use partprobe to register new partition with kernel

        [root@server1 ~]# fdisk /dev/vda

        Use fdisk, gdisk, or parted to create new partition for use with LVM

        Set the partition type:

            Use Linux LVM on LVM partitions

            Use 0x8e for MBR-style partitions

        If necessary, use partprobe to register new partition with kernel

        [root@server1 ~]# fdisk /dev/vda

    Create volume group (VG):

        Use vgcreate to create volume group

            VG size determined by total number of physical extents in pool

            VG hosts logical volumes by allocating free PEs to LV

            LV must have enough free PEs when LV is created

        To define VG name and list one or more PVs to allocate to VG, add arguments

        [root@server1 ~]# vgcreate vg-alpha /dev/vda2 /dev/vdb1

    Create logical volume:

        Use lvcreate with following options to create new logical volume from available physical extents in volume group:

            Use -n to set LV name

            Use -L to set LV size and identify VG that LV is created in

            [root@server1 ~]# lvcreate -n hercules -L 2G vg-alpha

Managing Logical Volumes

    There are multiple ways to specify size

        Use -L to specify size in bytes, mebibytes (binary megabytes, 1048576 bytes), or gibibytes (binary gigabytes)

        Use -l to specify size as number of PEs

    Examples:

        lvcreate -L 128M: Size logical volume to exactly 128MiB

        lvcreate -l 128: Size logical volume to exactly 128 extents

            Total number of bytes depends on size of PE block on underlying PV

    Tools may display logical volume name using:

        Traditional name /dev/vgname/lvname

        Kernel device mapper name /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname

    Add file system:

        Use mkfs to create XFS file system on new logical volume:

        [root@server1 ~]# mkfs -t xfs /dev/vg-alpha/hercules

        To make file system available across reboots, use mkdir to create mount point directory:

        [root@server1 ~]# mkdir /mnt/hercules

        Add entry to /etc/fstab:

        /dev/vg-alpha/hercules  /mnt/hercules  xfs  defaults 1 2

        To mount all file systems in /etc/fstab, including the entry just added, run mount -a:

        [root@server1 ~]# mount -a

Removing a Logical Volume

    Prepare file system:

        Move all data that must be kept to another file system

        Use umount to unmount file system

        Remember to remove /etc/fstab entries associated with the file system

        [root@server1 ~]# umount /mnt/hercules

    Remove logical volume:

        Use lvremove with device name as argument

        [root@server1 ~]# lvremove /dev/vg-alpha/hercules

        LV file system must be unmounted before running command

        lvremove asks for confirmation

        LV’s physical extents are now available for assignment to other LVs in volume group

    Remove volume group:

        Use vgremove with VG name as argument

        [root@server1 ~]# vgremove vg-alpha

        VG’s physical volumes are now available for assignment to VGs.

    Remove physical volumes:

        Use pvremove to remove physical volumes

        Add space-delimited list of PV devices to remove more than one device

        [root@server1 ~]# pvremove /dev/vda2 /dev/vdb1

        PV metadata is wiped from partition or disk

        Partition is free for reallocation or reformatting

Reviewing Physical Volume Information

    To display information about physical volumes, use pvdisplay

    If no arguments are specified, pvdisplay lists information for all PVs

    If device is specified as argument, only that PV is shown

       [root@server1 ~]# pvdisplay /dev/vda2

Reviewing Volume Group Information

    To display information about volume groups, use vgdisplay

    If no arguments are specified, vgdisplay shows all VGs

    If VG name is specified, only that VG is shown

    [root@server1 ~]# vgdisplay vg-alpha

Reviewing Logical Volume Information

    To display information about logical volumes, use lvdisplay

    If no arguments are specified, lvdisplay shows all LVs

    If LV name is specified, only that LV is shown

       [root@server1 ~]# lvdisplay /dev/vg-alpha/hercules

Extending Logical Volumes
Extending and Reducing Volume Groups

    Add physical volumes to volume group to increase its disk space

        Called extending volume group

    Can assign new physical extents to logical volumes

    Can remove unused physical volumes from volume group

        Called reducing volume group

    Use pvmove to move data from extents on one PV to extents on other PVs in volume group

        Add new disk to existing volume group

        Move data from older or slower disk to new disk

        Remove old disk from volume group

    Can be done while logical volumes in volume group are in use


Extending a Volume Group

    Prepare physical device:

        Use fdisk, gdisk, or parted to create new partition for use with LVM

        Set partition type:

            Use Linux LVM on LVM partitions

            Use 0x8e for MBR-style partitions

        If necessary, use partprobe to register new partition with kernel

        [root@server1 ~]# fdisk /dev/vdb

    Create physical volume:

        Use pvcreate to label partition (or other physical device) for use with LVM as physical volume

            Writes header directly to PV to store LVM configuration data

            PV is divided into PEs of fixed size; for example, 4MiB blocks

        To label multiple devices at same time, add space-delimited device names

        [root@server1 ~]# pvcreate /dev/vdb2

Extend volume group:

    Use vgextend to add new PV to volume group

    Use VG name and PV device name as arguments:

    [root@server1 ~]# vgextend vg-alpha /dev/vdb2

Verify new space is available:

    Use vgdisplay to confirm additional PEs are available

    Check Free PE/Size in output

        It should be greater than zero

        [root@server1 ~]# vgdisplay vg-alpha

Reducing a Volume Group

    Move physical extents:

        Use pvmove to relocate physical extents used on physical volume to other PVs in VG.

            Requires enough free extents in VG and all extents must come from other PVs

        Use PV device name from which PEs will be moved as argument

        [root@server1 ~]# pvmove /dev/vdb2

    Reduce volume group:

        Use vgreduce to remove PV from volume group

        Use VG name and PV device name as arguments:

        [root@server1 ~]# vgreduce vg-alpha /dev/vdb2

        To permanently stop using device as PV, use pvremove

Extending a Logical Volume and XFS File System

    Can increase LV size without downtime

    Can add free PEs in VG to LV to extend capacity

        Use to extend file system it contains

            Verify that volume group has space available:

        Use vgdisplay to verify that sufficient PEs are available

        [root@server1 ~]# vgdisplay vg-alpha

Check Free PE/Size for value equal to or greater than space required

    If space is insufficient, extend volume group

    Extend logical volume:

        Use lvextend to extend logical volume size

        Add LV device name as last argument

        [root@server1 ~]# lvextend -L +300M /dev/vg-alpha/hercules

    There are multiple ways to specify new size:

        Use -l to specify physical extent values

        Use -L to specify size in bytes, mebibytes, and gibibytes

    Examples:

        lvextend -l 128: Resize logical volume to exactly 128 extents

        lvextend -l +128: Add 128 extents to current size of logical volume

        lvextend -L 128M: Resize logical volume to exactly 128MiB

        lvextend -L +128M: Add 128MiB to current size of logical volume

        lvextend -l +50%FREE: Add 50 percent of current VG free space to LV

    Extend file system:

        Use xfs_growfs /mountpoint to expand file system to occupy extended LV

            Requires file system be mounted while being run

            Can continue to use file system while resizing

            [root@server1 ~]# xfs_growfs /mnt/hercules

        Can also use lvextend -r to resize file system after LV is extended

            Uses fsadm

            Works with several different file systems

        Verify new size of mounted file system

        df -h /mountpoint

Extending a Logical Volume and ext4 File System

    Verify volume group has space available:

        Use vgdisplay vgname to verify enough PEs are available

    Extend logical volume:

        Use lvextend -l +extents/dev/vgname/lvname to extend logical volume /dev/vgname/lvname by +extents.

    Extend file system

        Use resize2fs /dev/vgname/lvname to expand file system to occupy extended LV

            Can mount file system use it while extending

            To see progress of resize operation, use -p

            [root@server1 ~]# resize2fs /dev/vg-alpha/hercules
