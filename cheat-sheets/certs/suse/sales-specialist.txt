What’s is Open Source?
It’s open:
• To the public
• To change
• To innovation

Proprietary = closed,stop, do not open
Open source = open,go, do not close


Why Open Source?
- Freedom of choice
- Power of the community
- Top Service Levels
- Best of Breed Technology


“Linux and open source software solutions today are becoming an increasingly attractive option. [It] has emerged as one of
the most significant equalizers, bridging previously incompatible platforms with a common OS layer. The future of Linux is bright.

    —IDC, The Linux Market Today


Essential Linux Terminology 
- It’s GNU
- Linux is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is “free”
- Free refers to the freedom to distribute: You get the source code, you can change it, you can use pieces of the code in other free software – all rights and freedoms are passed along


It’s not a license…it’s a subscription
- You pay a subscription fee for support of your Linux distribution vs. a license fee for Linux software
- Subscriptions vary by service level and length of term
- Subscriptions are often defined in terms of Basic, Standard and Premium Maintenance contracts 


- Licensing is typically more expensive in the first year and then a lesser percentage is charged each year in maintenance
    - Maintenance is typically between 15-20% of the initial purchase price (or list price) per year

Subscription pricing is the same per year –
discounts are offered for longer 3-year subscription
periods



Reliability, Availability, Serviceability (RAS) + Scalability

    • Reliability: The ability of the software component to consistently perform according to its specifications.
    • Availability: The ratio of time a system or component is functional to the total time it is required or expected to function.
    • Serviceability: An expression of the ease with which a software component can be maintained or repaired.
    • Scalability: The ability to function well as the underlying hardware scales upward and takes full advantage of the added capacity.


All of which makes Linux a viable alternative to UNIX or Windows for mission-critical applications and services.


Why Linux
- RAS
- Performance and Scalability
- Affordability
- Innovation
- Open Source

“Linux is available on every major server architecture in use, ranging from IBM System z and Power Systems at the high end to ARM-based servers at the low end.

This vast range of deployment options gives Linux considerable flexibility to meet application requirements on the right architecture.”
